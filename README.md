## Data Analysis and Visualization

## Results/Findings

The analysis results as observed from the dashboard are summarized as follows:
1. Men earned more on average, with a salary of $60,124 compared to women, whose average salary was $55,774. Hence, men purchased more bikes, possibly due to their higher income.
2. Young adults(age <45) made the highest bike purchases, indicating a strong preference for bikes among them.
   Senior adults (age >65) bought the least number of bikes, indicating lower purchasing power compared to other age groups.
3. The professionals purchased the highest number of bikes compared to other occupations, highlighting their significant contribution to overall sales.
4. Sales were highest in North America Region. This indicates a strong market performance in that area .
5. The shorter the commute distance, the higher the number of bikes purchased. Conversely, the longer the commute distance, the fewer the number of bikes purchased.
6. Single individuals with children and married individuals with children made more bike purchases than those without children, regardless of marital status.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

- Develop high-end bike models and accessories targeted primarily at men with higher disposable incomes. In addition,offer financing or instalment plans to make bikes more affordable for customers with lower incomes.

- Target marketing campaigns to single individuals and married couples with children and emphasise the benefits of biking for family activities and health. Do more promotion of bikes suitable for families both online and in-store.

- Focus more on marketing in the North American region, using promotions and advertisements that match local preferences and trends.

- Develop marketing strategies that appeal to young adults and emphasize biking as an exercise that helps in keeping fit.

- Create attractive promotional offers aimed at professionals and emphasize biking as a convenient commuting option.

- Set up a robust customer feedback system to gather input and continuously improve products and services.

- Periodically analyze data to track sales trends and customer preferences, and use the results to adjust marketing and product strategies.

- Use digital marketing channels like social media, email, and search engine optimization(SEO) to increase brand visibility and reach a broader audience.
